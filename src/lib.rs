//! Tomb is a minimal crate that provides dice rolling mechanisms for games.
//!
//! Why use `tomb`:
//! - The name is great (short for _tombstones_, another name for _dice_)
//! - Requires close to no depdendencies (an optional one for the `fastrand` crate)
//! - Fully tested with generous example code
//!
//! One way to think about `tomb` is as a minimal _headless_ [tabletop simulator][].
